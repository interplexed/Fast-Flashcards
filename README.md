### About
Flashcards are a solid choice for making associations and learning concepts *by rote*.  They are also used in ASN/ ASD education as 'Power Cards' with great results.  This project is bringing Vue.js and Express.js together with MongoDB, hosted via Docker-Compose and Nginx.  

You can add flashcard collections as the topics of study and edit/ reorder the flashcards in the Manage Cards menu.
